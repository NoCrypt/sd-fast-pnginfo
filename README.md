# sd fast pnginfo

sd fast pnginfo is an extension for the [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). It allows you to view prompt from an image without the need to upload it to a server, resulting in fast pnginfo. This is particularly noticeable when running the webui in a public URL, such as colab.

The extension utilizes the [exifr](https://mutiny.cz/exifr/) Javascript library, which is already packed within the extension and does not require an external CDN.

Please note that the extension is completed.
